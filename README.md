# Pea

As repository description says - it's my attempt at writing **2D** deferred Vulkan renderer.

I don't know if I will finish it or if I will remove it day later - It's my personal project that may be used for another one (shh :D)

I advise you **not to use this project** since it's just like a sandbox - however feel free to use it **respecting license which you can look inside LICENSE file**.

# Branches

- main - "Stable" release "ready to use"
- dev - development branch
- qa - testing branch before pushing to main

# Plans

- Dynamic lightning on sprites (normal maps?)
- Scalability
- Easy API to use
- whatever stupid idea comes to my mind

# Roadmap

Right now I'm actually not working on this project. I'll have a good ammount of time in a few weeks - I'll push this project in that time (unless I'll have another programming burnout)

The roadmap isn't actually arranged in a proper way - it's just a list so I don't forget what I have to do :D

- Startup of renderer (prob basic triangle)
- Abstract api (to essentially make ports to different renderer libraries easier) (debatable still not sure if ill add another - if so then DX12 for 99%)
- Full Deferred rendering pipeline
- Probably some fancy pp effects
- Modularity (for a user)
- Implement ImGui (ill implement it probably after the bare bones base renderer)
- Implement Tracy
- DEBUG TOOLS FOR EACH PASS IN RENDERER!
- Any other things that come to my mind
