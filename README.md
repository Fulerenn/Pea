# Pea

As repository description says - it's my attempt at writing **2D** Vulkan renderer.

I don't know if I will finish it or if I will remove it day later - It's my personal project that may be used for another one (shh :D)

I advise you **not to use this project** since it's just like a sandbox - however feel free to use it **respecting license which you can look inside LICENSE file**.

# Branches

- main - "Stable" release "ready to use"
- dev - development branch
- qa - testing branch before pushing to main

# Plans

- Dynamic lightning
- Scalability
- Easy API to use
- whatever stupid idea comes to my mind
